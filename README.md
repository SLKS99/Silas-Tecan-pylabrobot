# SiLA2 Connector for Fluent
This repository contains a console application that exports the functionality of the FluentControl API as SiLA2 Server. 
This allows to call into the FluentControl API using other programming languages by means of a SiLA2 client. For convenience, the repository also already contains a ready-made Python client.
